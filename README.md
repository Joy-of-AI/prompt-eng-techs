**Overview**
In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence, prompt engineering has emerged as the fastest way for getting the most out of large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the skilful craft of designing inputs that guide language models like GPT-4 to produce accurate, contextually relevant, and meaningful outputs. Whether you're crafting prompts to generate creative content, analysing sentiment, or solving complex problems, understanding the nuances of prompt engineering can help you achieve better results.

Prompt engineering stands as both an art and a science since it involves a unique blend of creativity, intuition, and technical understanding to harness the full potential of AI models. The science ensures that prompts are grounded in a solid understanding of AI technology, while the art allows for innovative and customized solutions that can coax the best performance from these models. This duality is what makes prompt engineering both challenging and rewarding, requiring a balance of methodical testing and creative experimentation.

**Code Coverage**
This repo provides practical examples and python codes for fundamental techniques of prompt engineering, including zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. It also includes codes for advanced prompt engineering techniques including self-consistency, tree of thoughts, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), automatic reasoning and tool-use (ART), and ReAct prompting. EBy mastering these techniques, you can craft prompts that align closely with your objectives, optimising the performance and relevance of AI-generated outputs.
